Project C - Noah Sayed, Marie Clancy, Adam Carreira

Step 1: Marie
-------------
Created readFile() to read files into a buffer.

Step 2: Noah
------------
Created executeProgram() to load programs and execute all in one.

Step 3: Adam
------------
Allowed to program to go back to the OS when done, using an 
interrupt 21 call.

Step 4: Noah
------------
In this step we created a program by creating & compiling shell.c
and loading it onto the disk.

Step 5 & 6: Adam
----------------
Used the shell to recognize commands "type" and "exec" with errors
when the file is not found.
